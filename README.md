# Neural Quantile Regression

This repo implements the experiments for the paper:
```
Quantile regression with ReLU Networks: Estimators and minimax rates
O.H.M. Padilla, W. Tansey, and Y. Chen
https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08236
```

The code in `python/neural_model.py` implements a deep neural network quantile regression model for both univariate and multivariate responses.

## Requirements

Everything is implemented in `python3` with `pytorch` plus plotting with `seaborn` --- usual dependencies apply.
